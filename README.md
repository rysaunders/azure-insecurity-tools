# üîì azure-insecurity-tools

**A growing collection of offensive Azure tools and scripts** designed to support cloud red teaming, lab work, and deep exploration of Microsoft cloud internals.

---

## üì¶ What's Inside

This repo will evolve as I learn more about attacking Azure. The focus is hands-on, practical tooling for real-world and lab scenarios.

### ‚úÖ Initial Tool: `token_multiplexer.py`

Use a single `refresh_token` to mint multiple `access_token`s across different Azure resource scopes (Graph, Key Vault, ARM, etc).

#### Features
- Exchanges refresh tokens for any `.default` scoped resource
- Decodes JWT and extracts `aud`, `scp`, and `exp` claims
- Built as a CLI for flexible reuse
- Useful in phishing/OAuth abuse scenarios like AzRTE labs

#### Example Usage

```bash
python token_multiplexer.py \
  --refresh-token "<paste_here>" \
  --client-id "your-app-client-id" \
  --client-secret "your-app-client-secret" \
  --scope "https://vault.azure.net/.default"
```

### üîë kv-dump-old-versions.py ‚Äî Enumerate and Dump Azure Key Vault Secret Versions

This script enumerates secrets in Azure Key Vaults and retrieves all available versions, including old values that might remain after rotation.

Features
	‚Ä¢	Works on a single vault or all vaults in a subscription.
	‚Ä¢	Dumps all secret versions with flags for which one is latest.
	‚Ä¢	Supports table view (human-friendly) and JSON output (machine-friendly).
	‚Ä¢	Flags old values that differ from the latest version.

#### Usage
```bash
# Enumerate all vaults in a subscription
python3 kv-dump-old-versions.py --subscription-id <subscription-id>

# Target a specific vault and output as JSON
python3 kv-dump-old-versions.py --vault kv-1-2e693029 --output json
```

### üî¢ kv-rsa-decrypt.py
Tries common RSA algs against a given Key Vault key ID. Uses az under the hood to leverage existing logon.

#### Usage
```bash
python3 kv-rsa-decrypt.py \
  --key-id "https://kv-2-xxxx.vault.azure.net/keys/key-2-xxxx/<version>" \
  --ciphertext-b64 "G067ensX6Zgz...=="  # full base64 blob
# or force a specific algo:
python3 kv-rsa-decrypt.py --key-id ... --ciphertext-b64 ... --algo RSA-OAEP
```
